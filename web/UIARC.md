# UIArc component provenance

Adapted from the free UIArc Button and Segmented Control CSS at

The local adaptation retains semantic native controls, focus-visible rings, touch feedback,
reduced-motion support and restrained surface/selection styles. It uses the existing app
framework and identity palette rather than adding a second runtime. CSS tokens are scoped
with an `arc` prefix; controls retain existing click, busy, validation and authorization behavior.

Peek’s native macOS settings use SwiftUI’s own grouped forms, capsule buttons,
segmented pickers and adaptive system colors. Their spacing and hierarchy follow the
same direction; no web runtime or UIArc CSS was embedded in the native application.

The static build also ships the MIT notice at `/licenses/uiarc-MIT.txt`; the source CSS retains an attribution comment.
